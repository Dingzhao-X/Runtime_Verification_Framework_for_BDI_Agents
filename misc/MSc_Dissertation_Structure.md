# MSc Project Modules

> **Common baseline dissertation format:**

- 16 pages max excluding references and appendices -- Times New Roman
  font size 10

  - ACM (single column -- short paper)

  - Template shared with module leads

- Source code can be provided separately (but not marked)

> *If max pages or word count is already less than 16 or approx. 8,000
> respectively in a project module, that can be retained. Programmes
> with accreditation requirements that necessitate a specific length for
> dissertations, that should be adopted otherwise a maximum limit of 16
> pages (excl. references and appendices) should be set.*

**Example structure** and section weightage are provided below --
section titles, what is expected within each section, weightage of each
section, and referencing style can be customised.

- Introduction (10%)

  - Introduce and motivate the problem

  - Outline the aims and objectives

  - Provide an outline of the dissertation (how it is structured)

- Background & related work (10%)

  - Discuss key topics covered in the dissertation

  - Synthesise related work and state-of-the-art

- Methodology (30%)

  - Justify the choice of your method/approach/design

  - Describe the what, why, and how of your method/approach/design

- Results & evaluation (30%)

  - Outline the findings/outcomes of your work

  - Discuss and analyse the results of the evaluation of the outcomes

- Conclusion (10%)

  - Provide a summary of the project

  - Revisit the aims and objectives and explain how well these have been
    met

  - Outline any limitations of your work

  - Consider future, follow-on work

- References and Form (10%)

  - Use high quality references

  - Use a mix of academic and non-academic references (from reliable
    sources such as government reports)

  - Use the referencing style suggested

  - Form refers to structure, formatting, writing (spelling and
    grammar), and overall presentation of the dissertation. Students are
    not expected to create a separate section for this.

Below are some **resources** to help students plan and write succinctly
in an academic style:

- [Literature review/related work]{.underline}

- [Proposal/draft dissertation]{.underline}

- [Good academic practice including plagiarism, referencing, and use of
  AI]{.underline}

- [More information on writing a dissertation]{.underline}

# Additional information on [general marking criteria]{.underline} for levels 4, 5, 6, and 7 modules provided by SAgE:

The criteria can be found at the end of the document.

The descriptive equivalents are intended as a guideline only and
criteria will not necessarily apply equally to all pieces of assessed
work (for example, presentational issues are likely to be less important
for an answer to an examination question than for a project
dissertation). The Faculty expects that examiners will use the whole of
the marking scale and to interpret these criteria in the context of the
specific learning outcomes of the module or piece of assessed work, as
indicated in the Module Outline Form. Where appropriate, other marking
criteria may be used and in such cases they should be made available to
students in advance of the assessment. It is important to ensure that
feedback comments made on all assessed work justify the final mark
awarded based on these descriptors and clear explanations for any
deviations should be given.

[Application criteria]{.underline}:

- The criteria are intended to be applicable in principle to most types
  of assessment. They should form the basis for more specialised
  criteria for specific assessments.

- A particular piece of assessment may relate to some or all of the
  criteria. Assessments should normally test more than one criterion.

- The criteria should be interpreted in relation to the FHEQ level
  (Stage) of the assessment.

- The criteria should be interpreted in relation to what can reasonably
  be expected within the constraints of the assessment, such as time
  available or word limit.

- The mark awarded should reflect the best fit to the criteria used.
  Weighting of criteria and thresholds for specific aspects are not
  prescribed.

- Appropriate presentation of material (structure, use of language, oral
  and visual communication) is considered to be implicit in the
  criteria.

[Terminology]{.underline}:

- **Evidence** could be from taught material, reading, calculation,
  experimentation or other forms of practical activity.

- **Learning outcomes** should be defined by module outlines or
  additional guidance, for example from lecture outlines.

- **Expected material** is what would be needed to answer a question
  fully.

- **Going beyond taught material** could involve use of additional
  material from wider reading or interpretation of taught material in
  ways that are not directly implied.

- A **problem** could be conceptual or mathematical, theoretical or
  practical, seen or unseen and small-scale or large-scale.

# BCS Accreditation Guidelines:

Projects at postgraduate level may be similar in scope to undergraduate
projects but should reflect the ethos of advanced study and scholarship
appropriate to a masters degree (whether generalist or specialist).

Postgraduate projects must give students the opportunity to demonstrate:

- a systematic understanding of knowledge, and a critical awareness of
  current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed
  by, the forefront of the specialist academic discipline

- a comprehensive understanding of techniques applicable to their own
  research or advanced scholarship

- originality in the application of knowledge, together with a practical
  understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry
  are used to create and interpret knowledge in the discipline

- deal with complex issues both systematically and creatively, make
  sound judgements in the absence of complete data, and communicate
  their conclusions clearly to specialist and non- specialist audiences

- demonstrate self-direction and originality in tackling and solving
  problems, and act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a
  professional or equivalent level

- critical self-evaluation of the process

Generalist masters programme projects should be worth at least 30 credit
points and be at least at undergraduate honours level. It is recognised
that in practice a project on a masters programme is usually worth at
least 60 credits at Level 7.
