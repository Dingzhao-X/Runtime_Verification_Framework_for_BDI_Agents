## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents represent a prominent paradigm in multi-agent systems and autonomous computing, where agents make decisions based on their beliefs about the world, desires representing their goals, and intentions reflecting their committed plans [3]. As BDI agents are increasingly deployed in safety-critical and mission-critical applications, ensuring their behavioral correctness and reliability becomes paramount.

Traditional approaches to BDI agent verification have primarily focused on design-time analysis, where agent behaviors are verified against specifications before deployment [4]. However, the dynamic nature of agent environments and the uncertainty inherent in agent decision-making processes necessitate runtime verification approaches that can monitor and verify agent behavior during actual execution.

Quantitative approaches to BDI agent analysis have emerged as powerful methods for reasoning about probabilistic agent behaviors [5]. These approaches model agent behaviors using probabilistic formal models such as Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC), enabling the use of probabilistic model checking tools like PRISM to verify quantitative properties expressed in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL).

The challenge lies in bridging the gap between design-time quantitative models and runtime operational monitoring. While design-time models provide initial probabilistic assessments of agent behaviors, these models may not accurately reflect actual execution patterns observed during runtime. This discrepancy arises from several factors: environmental uncertainties, learning-based adaptation, and the inherent stochastic nature of agent decision-making processes.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current runtime verification approaches for BDI agents face several significant limitations:

1. **Model-Reality Gap**: Design-time probabilistic models often diverge from actual runtime behavior patterns, leading to inaccurate verification results.

2. **Static Probability Distributions**: Existing approaches rely on fixed probability distributions that do not adapt to observed execution traces.

3. **Repeated State Handling**: When agent execution traces contain repeated states (cycles), traditional model updating approaches can introduce significant inaccuracies by overwriting original probability distributions.

4. **Integration Complexity**: Combining offline verification with real-time monitoring requires sophisticated coordination between multiple verification processes.

### 1.3 Aim and Objectives

**Aim**: To develop a comprehensive runtime verification framework for BDI agents that integrates quantitative operational monitoring with adaptive probability model updates, addressing both offline simulation verification and real-time operational monitoring scenarios.

**Objectives**:

1. Design and implement a dual-scenario verification architecture supporting both offline batch verification (Scenario A) and real-time monitoring (Scenario B).

2. Develop novel algorithms for handling repeated states in execution traces to preserve the integrity of original probability distributions during model updates.

3. Create automated tooling for transforming BDI agent behavioral models into PRISM-compatible formats and updating probability distributions based on observed traces.

4. Evaluate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive experimental validation using various agent behavior patterns and execution scenarios.

5. Demonstrate practical applicability through a complete implementation supporting cross-platform deployment and real-time operation.

### 1.4 Contributions

This dissertation makes the following key contributions:

1. **Novel Repeated State Handling Algorithm**: We introduce a systematic approach to handle repeated states in execution traces, preventing the corruption of original probability distributions during model updates.

2. **Dual-Scenario Architecture**: We present a unified framework supporting both offline verification and real-time monitoring through coordinated process interaction.

3. **Automated Model Transformation Pipeline**: We provide comprehensive tooling for automating the transformation between different model formats (TRA, PRISM, CSL) and probability updates.

### 1.5 Dissertation Structure

The remainder of this dissertation is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the background and related work in BDI agent verification and quantitative approaches. Section 3 describes our methodology including the dual-scenario architecture and repeated state handling algorithms. Section 4 presents comprehensive experimental results and evaluation. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of limitations and future work.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 BDI Agent Architecture

The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture, originally proposed by Bratman [6], provides a structured approach to autonomous agent design. In BDI systems, agents maintain three key mental attitudes: beliefs representing their knowledge about the world, desires representing their goals, and intentions representing their committed plans.

The BDI execution cycle involves several key phases: belief revision, where agents update their world knowledge based on observations; option generation, where agents identify possible actions; deliberation, where agents select appropriate goals and plans; and intention execution, where agents carry out their committed actions [7].

### 2.2 Quantitative Approaches to BDI Analysis

Traditional BDI verification approaches have largely focused on qualitative analysis using temporal logics and model checking [8]. However, the inherently probabilistic nature of agent decision-making and environmental uncertainty has driven the development of quantitative approaches.

Xu et al. [1] presents a comprehensive framework for quantitative modeling and analysis of BDI agents using Bigraphs and probabilistic model checking. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for representing BDI agent semantics in probabilistic formal models and demonstrates the application of PRISM model checking for verifying quantitative properties of agent behaviors.

The approach involves several key steps: (1) encoding BDI agent semantics using Bigraphical Reactive Systems, (2) transforming Bigraph transition systems into Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC), (3) model checking the resulting DTMC using PRISM against PCTL properties.

### 2.3 Operational Monitoring for BDI Agents

Building upon quantitative modeling foundations, Xu et al. [2] introduces the concept of quantitative operational monitoring for BDI agents. This approach combines design-time modeling with runtime monitoring to provide continuous verification of agent behaviors during execution.

The operational monitoring framework introduces a dual-phase approach: (1) Design Time analysis, where initial probabilistic models are constructed and verified, and (2) Runtime monitoring, where actual execution traces are used to update probability distributions and re-verify critical properties.

This framework addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining verification accuracy as agent behaviors evolve during runtime execution. However, the original framework does not adequately address the complexities introduced by repeated states in execution traces.

### 2.4 Runtime Verification

Runtime verification represents a lightweight formal verification technique that monitors system execution against formal specifications [9]. Unlike traditional model checking approaches that require complete system state exploration, runtime verification focuses on analyzing actual execution traces.

For probabilistic systems, runtime verification faces unique challenges: (1) partial observability, where only limited execution information is available, (2) statistical inference, where probabilistic properties must be estimated from finite execution traces, and (3) adaptive model updating, where probabilistic models must be refined based on observed behaviors.

### 2.5 PRISM Model Checker

PRISM [10] is a probabilistic model checker that supports the modeling and analysis of systems with stochastic behavior. PRISM models are described using a simple, state-based language and analyzed against properties specified in temporal logic.

For our runtime verification framework, PRISM serves two key purposes: (1) initial verification of design-time probabilistic models, and (2) re-verification of updated models based on runtime observations. PRISM's support for DTMC analysis and PCTL property verification makes it ideally suited for our quantitative operational monitoring approach.

### 2.6 Identified Gaps

While existing work provides strong theoretical foundations for quantitative BDI agent analysis and operational monitoring, several critical gaps remain:

1. **Repeated State Handling**: Current approaches do not adequately address the challenges introduced by repeated states in execution traces, which can lead to incorrect probability updates.

2. **Real-Time Integration**: Existing frameworks lack comprehensive integration between offline verification and real-time monitoring capabilities.

3. **Practical Implementation**: Most existing approaches remain at the theoretical level without providing complete, deployable implementations.

4. **Automated Tooling**: There is a lack of comprehensive automated tooling for model transformation and probability updates.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Framework Architecture

Our runtime verification framework adopts a dual-scenario architecture designed to address both offline verification requirements (Scenario A) and real-time monitoring needs (Scenario B). This architecture provides comprehensive coverage of verification scenarios encountered in practical BDI agent deployments.

#### 3.1.1 Scenario A: Offline Simulation Verification

Scenario A addresses offline verification requirements where complete execution traces are available for post-hoc analysis. This scenario is particularly relevant for simulation-based verification, testing, and validation activities.

The Scenario A pipeline implements a five-stage automated process:

1. **Model Loading**: Load the original transition matrix (TRA format) and property specifications (CSL format)
2. **Initial Verification**: Execute PRISM model checking to establish baseline probability measurements
3. **Trace Processing**: Analyze observed execution traces to extract state transition patterns
4. **Model Updating**: Apply probability updates based on observed transitions, with special handling for repeated states
5. **Re-verification**: Execute PRISM model checking on updated models to assess behavioral changes

[INSERT FIGURE HERE: scenario_a_workflow.svg]

**Fig. 1: Scenario A Offline Verification Workflow** 
#### 3.1.2 Scenario B: Real-Time Operational Monitoring

Scenario B addresses real-time monitoring requirements where verification must occur concurrently with agent execution. This scenario supports continuous operational monitoring for deployed BDI agents.

The Scenario B architecture implements a dual-process approach:

1. **Agent Simulation Process**: Simulates agent decision-making and behavior execution, writing observed transitions to a shared execution trace file
2. **Runtime Verification Process**: Monitors the shared trace file, triggers model updates, and performs continuous verification

The two processes communicate through a shared file system, enabling loose coupling while maintaining synchronization for verification activities.

[INSERT FIGURE HERE: scenario_b_architecture.svg]

**Fig. 2: Scenario B Real-Time Monitoring Architecture**.

### 3.2 Repeated State Handling Algorithm

A critical contribution of our framework is the novel approach to handling repeated states in execution traces. When agent execution involves cycles or repeated visits to the same states, naive probability updating can corrupt the original probability distributions by overwriting them with observations from later visits.

#### 3.2.1 Problem Analysis

Consider an execution trace where state `s` is visited multiple times: `s0 → s1 → s2 → s1 → s3`. In this trace, state `s1` appears at positions 1 and 3. Traditional approaches would update the transition probabilities from `s1` based on the observed transitions at both positions, potentially overwriting the original probabilities with artificially constrained distributions.

[INSERT FIGURE HERE: state_transition_example.svg]

**Fig. 3: State Transition Example with Repeated States**

#### 3.2.2 Solution Approach

Our repeated state handling algorithm addresses this challenge through the following approach:

1. **Repeated State Detection**: Identify all states that appear multiple times in the execution trace
2. **Original Probability Preservation**: For repeated states, preserve the original probability distributions from the initial model
3. **Selective Update Strategy**: Apply probability updates only to non-repeated transitions while maintaining original distributions for repeated state transitions

#### 3.2.3 Theoretical Foundation

Our strategy for handling repeated states is based on the following theoretical principles:

1. **First-occurrence Recording**: Only the first occurrence of each state's transition is recorded in the updated model, preserving the original decision context. This strategy assumes that the observed path represents a single irreversible decision flow, conforming to the static definition requirements of DTMC model "deterministic transition probabilities".

2. **Historical Consistency**: Repeated states in this semantic context are treated as "revisits caused by prior history" and should not alter the original behavioral record for that state. This approach maintains the integrity of the original probabilistic model while incorporating observed behavioral patterns.

3. **Probability Space Preservation**: By maintaining original distributions for repeated states, we ensure that the model retains its full probabilistic expressiveness rather than being artificially constrained by limited observations.

The algorithm maintains the integrity of the probabilistic model while incorporating observed execution information, ensuring that repeated visits do not artificially constrain the probability space.

#### 3.2.4 Implementation Details

11. WriteUpdatedModel(output_tra, updated_probabilities)
```

### 3.3 Model Transformation Pipeline

The framework implements a comprehensive model transformation pipeline that automates the conversion between different model formats required for verification activities.

#### 3.3.1 TRA to PRISM Transformation

The TRA (transition matrix) format provides a compact representation of probabilistic transition systems. Our transformation pipeline converts TRA files into PRISM model format, enabling direct verification using PRISM model checker.

The transformation process involves:
1. **State Space Analysis**: Extract state space information from TRA format
2. **Module Generation**: Generate PRISM module definitions with appropriate state variables
3. **Transition Generation**: Convert probabilistic transitions into PRISM command format
4. **Label Integration**: Incorporate state labels for property specification

#### 3.3.2 Probability Update Pipeline

The probability update pipeline processes observed execution traces to generate updated probabilistic models:

1. **Trace Parsing**: Extract state sequences from execution trace files
2. **Transition Mapping**: Map observed state sequences to transition probabilities
3. **Repeated State Processing**: Apply repeated state handling algorithms
4. **Model Generation**: Generate updated TRA and PRISM models

### 3.4 Integration with PRISM Model Checker

The framework integrates closely with PRISM model checker to provide comprehensive verification capabilities. This integration involves several components:

#### 3.4.1 Property Specification

Properties are specified using PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic) and stored in CSL (PRISM property specification) format. Typical properties include:
- Reachability probabilities: `P=? [ F "target_state" ]`
- Bounded until properties: `P=? [ "state_A" U<=k "state_B" ]`
- Long-run probabilities: `S=? [ "steady_state" ]`

#### 3.4.2 Verification Execution

The framework automates PRISM execution through system calls, capturing and parsing verification results for analysis and comparison.

#### 3.4.3 Scenario B Process Coordination

For real-time monitoring (Scenario B), the framework supports flexible process coordination:

**Execution Flexibility**: The agent and verifier processes can be started in any order. The system uses file locking and polling mechanisms to handle scenarios where one process starts before the other, ensuring robust operation regardless of startup sequence. This design allows for practical deployment scenarios where processes may need to be restarted independently or started at different times.

### 3.5 Cross-Platform Implementation

The implementation provides cross-platform compatibility through several design decisions:

1. **Standard C++17**: Use of modern C++ standards ensures broad compiler compatibility
2. **Static Linking**: Static linking of standard libraries prevents runtime dependency issues
3. **Conditional Compilation**: Platform-specific code sections handle differences in system calls and file operations
4. **Standardized Build System**: Makefile-based build system with Windows batch script alternatives

#### 3.5.1 Concurrency Control

To ensure safe concurrent access to shared files between the agent and verifier processes, we implemented a comprehensive file locking mechanism using platform-specific system locks:

- **Windows Implementation**: Uses `CreateFile` with exclusive access flags and `FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE` for automatic cleanup
- **Linux Implementation**: Uses `flock` system call for advisory locking with `LOCK_EX` for exclusive access
- **Lock Files**: Creates `.lock` files to coordinate access to PM and path files, preventing race conditions
- **Timeout Mechanism**: Prevents deadlocks with configurable timeout periods (typically 2-3 seconds)
- **RAII Pattern**: Implements Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) pattern through `FileGuard` class for exception-safe lock management

This concurrency control ensures that when the verifier updates model files, the agent safely reads the latest version without file corruption or inconsistent states. The system handles scenarios where multiple processes attempt to access the same files simultaneously, maintaining data integrity throughout the verification process.

### 3.6 Experimental Design

The experimental validation follows a systematic approach designed to evaluate framework effectiveness across multiple dimensions:

#### 3.6.1 Test Data Generation

We generate three categories of test data:
1. **Simple Test Cases**: Linear execution traces without repeated states for baseline validation
2. **Loop Test Cases**: Execution traces with repeated states to validate repeated state handling algorithms
3. **Complex Test Cases**: Multi-branch execution patterns with complex state revisitation patterns

#### 3.6.2 Evaluation Metrics

Framework evaluation focuses on several key metrics:
1. **Verification Accuracy**: Comparison of verification results with and without repeated state handling
2. **Performance Efficiency**: Execution time analysis for both scenarios
3. **Scalability Assessment**: Framework behavior with increasing model and trace complexity
4. **Real-Time Performance**: Latency analysis for Scenario B real-time monitoring

## 4. Results and Evaluation

### 4.1 Implementation Overview

**Prerequisites**: Ensure that PRISM model checker is installed and added to the system PATH environment variable for proper operation.

The complete framework implementation consists of approximately 3,200 lines of C++17 code organized into a modular architecture with static library components. The implementation includes:

- **Scenario B Applications**: 450 lines implementing real-time monitoring (dual process) with file locking
- **Test Data and Scripts**: Comprehensive test suite with automated validation and cross-platform build scripts

### 4.2 Repeated State Handling Validation

#### 4.2.1 Experimental Setup

To validate the repeated state handling algorithm, we designed a specific test case (`loop_test`) containing a execution trace with multiple repeated states:
- Execution Path: `0→1→2→3→1→2→4→1→7`
- Repeated States: State 1 (visited 3 times), State 2 (visited 2 times)
- Original TRA Model: 8 states, 11 transitions

The experimental results demonstrate significant differences between standard probability updates and repeated state handling:

**Without Repeated State Handling**:
- State 1 transitions artificially constrained to observed patterns
- Original probability distributions overwritten by partial observations
- Verification results show artificially reduced uncertainty

These directions could further advance the state of the art in runtime verification for autonomous agent systems.

#### C.2 PM File Comparison for Repeated State Handling

The following shows the difference between updated PM files with and without repeated state handling:

**Original PM File (used by agent when --repeated is enabled):**

```
dtmc

module tra_model
    s : [0..7] init 0;

    [] s=0 -> 1.0000:(s'=1);
    [] s=1 -> 0.6000:(s'=2) + 0.4000:(s'=7);
    [] s=2 -> 0.8000:(s'=3) + 0.2000:(s'=4);
    [] s=3 -> 0.5000:(s'=1) + 0.5000:(s'=5);
    [] s=4 -> 0.4000:(s'=1) + 0.6000:(s'=6);
    [] s=5 -> 1.0000:(s'=6);
    [] s=6 -> 1.0000:(s'=7);
endmodule
```

**Updated PM File (used for verification):**
```
dtmc

module tra_model
    s : [0..7] init 0;

    [] s=0 -> 1.0000:(s'=1);
    [] s=1 -> 1.0000:(s'=2) + 0.0000:(s'=7);
    [] s=2 -> 0.0000:(s'=3) + 1.0000:(s'=4);
    [] s=3 -> 0.0000:(s'=1) + 1.0000:(s'=5);
    [] s=4 -> 1.0000:(s'=1) + 0.0000:(s'=6);
    [] s=5 -> 1.0000:(s'=6);
    [] s=6 -> 1.0000:(s'=7);
endmodule

#### C.3 Agent Execution Path Analysis

```
Execution Path Analysis:
========================
Action Step State
act    0    0     (Initial state)
act    1    1     (First visit to state 1)
act    2    2     (First visit to state 2)
act    3    4     (Transition to state 4)
act    4    1     (Second visit to state 1 - REPEATED STATE)
act    5    2     (Second visit to state 2 - REPEATED STATE)
act    6    3     (First visit to state 3)
act    7    5     (First visit to state 5)
act    8    6     (First visit to state 6)
act    9    7     (Terminal state reached)

Repeated State Analysis:
========================
- State 1: Visited at steps 1 and 4 (repeated)
- State 2: Visited at steps 2 and 5 (repeated)
- Original probabilities preserved for repeated states in agent runtime
- Updated probabilities used for verification model

Agent Decision Process:
======================
- Agent uses original PM file (loop_test.pm) with preserved probabilities
- When reaching repeated states, original transition probabilities are maintained
- This allows for probabilistic behavior even on repeated visits
- Verifier uses updated PM file (loop_test_updated.pm) for accurate verification
```
